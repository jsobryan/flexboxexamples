                    <p>File not found. Look, last night was a mistake. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

                    I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be fearedâ€¦ Shut up and take my money! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
                    
                    Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>

                    <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Hey, whatcha watching? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

                    Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Guess again. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!</p>

                    <p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! I'm a thing. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
